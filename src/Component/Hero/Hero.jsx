           pre-historic rock shelter formed naturally out of a strange disposition of three huge boulders
            making one to rest on the other two with its bottom jutting out in between and serving as the
             roof. Edakkal literally means a stone in between.The discovery of the cave and its identification
              as a prehistoric site were quite accidental by F. Fawcett, the then superintendent of police.
